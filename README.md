# Poverty Prediction Model
## introduction
The Poverty Probability Index (PPI) is a tool for measuring poverty.
PPI predicts the likelihood that a household is living below the poverty line based on the answers to ten country-specific questions regarding a household's characteristics and asset ownership. 
Poverty is when individuals donâ€™t have the financial resources to care for their basic everyday needs that include but are not limited to food, clothing and shelter.
Poverty is a major problem affecting individuals in underdeveloped countries.

## Dataset
This dataset was used for a competition hosted by Microsoft where they had to predict the probability of whether an individual is under the poverty threshold of 2.5$ per day in seven countries.

The data was collected from Financial Inclusion Insights household surveys conducted by InterMedia.
